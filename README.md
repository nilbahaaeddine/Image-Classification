# Magiefication
A nice description.

## Authors
GoFocus members :
* Meriem AMERAOUI
* Dounia BELABIOD
* Jihene BOUHLEL
* Bahaa Eddine NIL

## Requirements
Python 3 is used during development and the following libraries are required to run the code provided in the notebook :
* NumPy = 1.17.2
* Matplotlib = 3.1.1
* Keras = 2.3.1
* TensorFlow = 2.2.0

## Notes
The `classes` folder contains all the classes we've implemented.
---
We have 3 notebooks in this project :
```
* ConvolutionalNeuralNetwok.ipynb : Our main file where we display the data and create the model to classify images.
* DataGenerator.ipynb : In this file we generate more data from the same image.
* KerasModel.ipynb : Creation of the Keras model to classify images.
```
---
The `requirements.txt` file lists all the Python libraries on which the notebooks of this project depend, you can install them using :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
The `ressouces` folder contains all the secondary files necessary for the project (Gantt diagram, report, video presentation and slides).
